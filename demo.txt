Hey !

You can see a demo of what it looks like on my personnal website.
(The website is still under construction)

That's the background of the page. You can try to move your cursor to see the stars going slower or faster.
Don't hesitate to take the code from my website. If you want to use it for your personnal website, just make
me appear on a comment inside the code.

I'm still a newbie with Three.js, but trying to improve. If you have any recommandations or questions, don't hesitate.
